# **The Potential of Artificial Intelligence in Detecting Humor in Images and Videos**

The question of whether artificial intelligence (AI) can discern humor in visual content touches upon a fascinating and complex frontier in the field of AI and cognitive science. Humor, an intricate aspect of human communication and social interaction, is deeply intertwined with our understanding of context, culture, and emotion 1. While seemingly a straightforward query, the ability of AI to identify what humans perceive as funny represents a significant benchmark in the development of artificial general intelligence, potentially leading to more natural and empathetic interactions between humans and computers 4. Given the subjective nature of humor and its perceived uniqueness to human experience 5, exploring the capabilities of AI in this domain offers valuable insights into the progress of machine cognition 5.

Artificial intelligence has made remarkable strides in the analysis of visual information, revolutionizing how computers interpret and understand the visual world 10. Modern AI systems possess the capacity to analyze images and videos across multiple dimensions, extracting meaningful insights through sophisticated algorithms 10. In the realm of image analysis, current AI systems offer a diverse range of capabilities, including object recognition and classification, facial recognition and emotion detection, text extraction from images, pattern identification, quantitative image analysis, and even forensic image analysis applications 10. These systems leverage computer vision algorithms, deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and various image processing techniques to perform tasks that once required human expertise 10. AI can classify images into predefined categories, detect and locate specific objects within an image, segment images into meaningful regions, enhance image quality through noise reduction and super-resolution, and identify anomalies or outliers 13. Furthermore, AI's ability to process and analyze images in real-time has enabled critical applications in fields like autonomous driving, where understanding the visual environment is paramount for navigation and safety, and medical imaging, where AI can assist in early diagnosis by detecting subtle patterns invisible to the human eye 11. Beyond mere identification, AI can automate repetitive tasks such as image tagging and sorting, and even provide predictive insights based on the analysis of visual data 11. In video analysis, AI is similarly transforming the landscape by enabling the automated processing of both live and recorded video streams at an unprecedented scale 16. AI systems can now recognize a vast array of objects and activities within video, track individuals as they move, detect unusual events or anomalies, and even predict potential outcomes, all in real-time 16. This has led to significant advancements in various sectors, including surveillance and security, where AI can continuously monitor video feeds for threats, healthcare, where it can aid in diagnostics and patient monitoring, smart cities, for traffic management and public safety, manufacturing, for quality control and safety, and sports analysis, for performance assessment 18. The techniques employed in AI video analysis often involve deep learning models like CNNs for frame-by-frame analysis and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for understanding temporal sequences and video dynamics 19. Video AI can recognize tens of thousands of objects, places, and actions, extract rich metadata at different levels of granularity, and perform tasks such as object detection and tracking, shot change detection, text detection using optical character recognition (OCR), and explicit content detection 20. Libraries like OpenCV and more advanced toolboxes like Detectron2 are instrumental in developing these sophisticated computer vision models for both image and video analysis 14.

Despite these remarkable capabilities in visual perception, the task of computationally identifying humor presents a unique set of challenges rooted in the very nature of humor itself 1. Understanding humor transcends the mere recognition of visual elements; it necessitates a nuanced comprehension of context, subtle cues, cultural references, and the underlying intent behind the content 1. Even in the realm of textual humor detection, AI must go beyond the literal meaning of words to grasp the embedded wit and intended comedic effect 1. Humor often hinges on cognitive processes such as the swift processing of incongruities, unexpected twists, and wordplay, requiring a level of abstract reasoning that is not always straightforward for AI models 1. The crucial role of context and tone in humor analysis further complicates matters 1. Sarcasm and irony, for instance, rely heavily on contextual cues and emotional undertones, making them particularly difficult for AI to interpret accurately 1. A fundamental challenge lies in the subjective nature of humor 2. What one individual finds amusing can vary significantly based on personal experiences, cultural background, and even their current mood 22. Humor often plays off specific cultural, social, or situational contexts, requiring a deep understanding of shared norms and in-jokes that AI models trained on broad datasets might miss 2. Good comedy often relies on precise timing and pacing, elements that AI, which tends to generate text or process information in a continuous flow, struggles to replicate 2. Furthermore, humor is frequently tied to emotions like sarcasm, irony, or absurdity, which AI, lacking genuine emotional experience, can mimic but not truly feel, potentially resulting in humor that feels technically correct but lacks genuine comedic impact 2. Wordplay and ambiguity, common comedic devices, require an understanding of multiple layers of meaning in language, which can also present hurdles for AI models 2. Human comedians often take creative risks and play with societal boundaries to elicit laughter, whereas AI systems are often designed with safety filters that make them risk-averse, potentially leading to humor that feels safe but bland 2. The unexpected turns and sometimes illogical twists that characterize great jokes are also difficult for AI to generate or fully appreciate, as AI often tries to follow logical patterns 2. Large Language Models (LLMs), while powerful in many natural language tasks, often struggle with humor due to a lack of genuine creativity and real-world grounding, sometimes merely imitating surface-level aspects of comedic styles without capturing the underlying essence 2. Humor is a complex interplay of emotion, cognition, linguistics, and even physical responses, and comes in many forms, such as slapstick, satire, and dark humor, each with its own unique characteristics and appeals, adding further layers of complexity for AI to understand 9. Ultimately, humor often hinges on the unexpected – an incongruity between expectation and reality – which requires AI to not only recognize patterns but also to understand and subvert them in a way that resonates with human sensibilities 9. Some even suggest that humor is intrinsically linked to the evolved behavior of play, something that current LLMs are not capable of 2. Moreover, understanding humor can require the comprehension of nonlinear narratives and the ability to interpret meaning derived from the juxtaposition of different elements, as often seen in comics, which presents another significant challenge for AI 25.

Despite these considerable challenges, researchers have explored various methods and techniques to enable AI to detect humor in both images and videos. Humor detection is often approached as a classification problem, where the AI model is trained to categorize content as either humorous or not humorous 28. This is typically achieved using a range of machine learning models, including Support Vector Machines (SVMs), CNNs, LSTMs, and more recently, transformer-based architectures 28. The features used to train these models can be diverse, encompassing lexical (word-based), syntactic (sentence structure), and semantic (meaning-based) elements, as well as sentiment analysis to gauge emotional tone and emotion recognition to identify specific feelings conveyed 1. In some approaches, pragmatic principles such as implicature (implied meaning) and presupposition (assumptions made) are also considered 28. Recognizing the complexity, some researchers advocate for a blended strategy that combines the strengths of machine learning with human insights to improve humor detection 6. More advanced techniques like game theory and the generator-discriminator framework, where one AI generates potential jokes and another evaluates their humorousness, are also being explored as a way to push the boundaries of AI humor understanding 6. While rule-based systems that rely on predefined linguistic patterns and semantic relationships have been developed, they often struggle with the inherent context-sensitivity and cultural variability of humor 31. Statistical learning techniques, including SVMs, Naive Bayes, decision trees, and random forests, have also been applied to the task, showing promise in identifying certain types of humor like puns and wordplay 31. In the specific context of image-based humor detection, research has investigated the role of visual elements such as scale incongruity – the discrepancy between expected and actual object size – as a potential source of humor 32. Early attempts involved systems that could manipulate the humor level in abstract scenes created from templates, although these had limitations in truly understanding *why* a scene was funny 32. More recent efforts focus on training models to predict the funniness of an image based on semantic visual features like the types of objects present and their spatial relationships within the scene 34. A notable development is the creation of specialized datasets like HumorDB, which is specifically designed for advancing visual humor understanding and allows for evaluation through various tasks like binary classification (funny or not funny), funniness rating on a scale, and pairwise comparison of images 35. Initial experiments on such datasets have shown that vision-language models, which can process both visual and textual information, are showing promising results in tackling the complexities of visual humor 35. One approach to generating humorous captions for images involves extracting visual details, ideating on potential humorous elements, and then extrapolating narratives based on common human experiences 38. Other techniques explored include searching for the most thematically or visually similar captions in a database to a given image, or transferring the image's visual features into the same vector space as textual descriptions 39. The use of abstract scenes allows researchers to isolate and understand the specific semantic content within an image that contributes to a humorous perception 34. For video-based humor detection, a significant trend is the use of multimodal approaches that combine information from the video's visual frames, audio track, and any available text, such as subtitles 29. Some methods rely on extracting textual cues from the audio using Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, although the accuracy of these transcriptions can sometimes be a limiting factor 29. To address this, systems like AVR have been developed to fuse audio and visual information directly, bypassing the need for text-based analysis 29. Multimodal datasets like Passau-SFCH and CMU-MOSI are crucial for training and evaluating these models 28. Some datasets provide humor labels with precise timestamps, allowing for the prediction of humor induced solely by visual cues or specific moments in the video 40. Models like FunnyNet-W leverage visual, audio, and textual data (often using ASR and Large Language Models) to identify funny moments within videos, achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks 44. Unsupervised approaches that utilize the time-aligned comments made by viewers in response to videos as a source of humor labels are also being investigated 41. Analyzing a combination of speech features (e.g., prosody), textual content, and visual cues has proven effective in distinguishing between humorous and non-humorous segments in videos 41. Furthermore, the detection of laughter in the audio track of a video is often used as a strong indicator of humor 41. Research has also shown that specific prosodic characteristics of speech, such as tempo, pitch, and energy, can differ significantly between humorous and non-humorous speech, providing another avenue for AI-based humor recognition 4.

Current research in visual humor analysis is an active and evolving field, with numerous projects exploring different facets of this complex problem. One significant effort is the development of HumorDB, a meticulously curated image dataset paired with human humor ratings, which serves as a benchmark for evaluating how well AI models can understand graphical humor 35. The AVR application represents another research direction, focusing on audio-visual humor detection in videos without relying on the accuracy of transcribed text 29. The investigation into scale incongruity as a potential source of visual humor highlights the exploration of specific visual cues that might trigger a humorous response 32. Several studies analyze the interplay of speech, text, and visual features within videos to predict the presence of humor, aiming to capture the multimodal nature of comedic content 29. The FunnyNet-W model stands out as a state-of-the-art approach that leverages visual, audio, and text modalities to detect funny moments in videos, demonstrating the power of multimodal learning 44. The YESBUT benchmark specifically targets AI's understanding of humor in comics that arises from the juxtaposition of panels, assessing the models' ability to grasp narrative humor 26. Researchers are also exploring methods to automatically generate humor labels for videos by analyzing the timestamps of user comments indicating laughter or amusement, offering a way to create large-scale labeled datasets 41. The development of laughter detection techniques within videos is another area of focus, as laughter is a strong indicator of perceived humor 42. Furthermore, computational models are being designed to not only predict how funny a scene is but also to understand what elements within the scene contribute to its humor, with the goal of potentially altering the scene to increase or decrease its funniness 34. While dedicated AI tools specifically for *analyzing* visual humor are still in their nascent stages, a variety of AI-powered tools for *creating* visual content exist and could potentially be adapted or used in conjunction with humor analysis tasks. These include AI-powered design platforms like Canva, Crello, and Adobe Spark, which enable users to easily create graphics 48. AI video creation tools such as Pictory, Magisto, and Animoto automate various aspects of video editing and production 48. PageOn.ai is a visual AI tool designed to simplify content creation and generate visuals from data 49. Canva, in addition to its design capabilities, offers AI-powered features like layout and font suggestions, as well as tools for image generation and editing 48. Jeda.ai is a multimodal AI online whiteboard that allows users to generate diverse visual content, including diagrams and AI art 50. WritingMate.ai provides an AI Art Critic tool that can analyze uploaded images and offer feedback in various styles, including a "Humorous" critique 51. For those interested in creating funny videos, platforms like Quickads.ai, VEED.IO, InVideo, and Hugging Face offer AI tools that can help generate humorous video ideas and even assist with scriptwriting 52. Advanced multimodal models like GPT-4o, with their integrated vision capabilities, are also being explored for their potential in visual humor analysis, particularly in tasks like extracting detailed visual information and ideating on potential humorous elements within an image 38.

The accuracy and reliability of current AI models in judging the funniness of visual content vary considerably depending on the specific task, the dataset used for training and evaluation, and the methods employed 28. In the realm of textual humor detection, some studies have reported impressive accuracy rates. For instance, one study achieved 93% accuracy in testing for textual humor by using an ensemble of machine learning algorithms 30. Another research effort focusing on puns and short jokes in text reported even higher accuracy, reaching up to 93.1% for pun detection and 98.6% for short joke detection 53. However, when it comes to visual humor, the performance of AI models often falls short of human capabilities. In a study that compared human and AI performance in matching captions to cartoons, humans achieved an accuracy of 94%, while the best-performing AI model using a pixel-based approach only reached 62%. An approach that involved AI generating descriptions of the cartoons before caption matching yielded a better accuracy of 84.5%, but still below human performance 54. In the context of the New Yorker Caption Contest, a challenging task requiring understanding of subtle humor and cultural references, GPT-4 performed slightly better than human estimates in predicting the editor's top three captions but underperformed when it came to predicting the crowd's picks 54. Interestingly, research on AI-generated jokes has shown that when the source of the joke (human or AI) is concealed, human participants sometimes rate AI-generated jokes as comparable in funniness to those created by humans, and they often struggle to accurately identify the source 55. Repeated exposure to AI-generated humor can even lead to increased appreciation among human evaluators 55. In multimodal humor detection in videos, some studies have reported promising results. One study achieved high Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores of 0.773 for the audio modality and 0.925 for the video modality in distinguishing humorous content 28. A model called C-MFN reportedly achieved higher accuracy on a multimodal humor dataset than human performance, suggesting that there is still significant potential for improvement in this area 53. FunnyNet-W, a model designed for detecting funny moments in videos using multimodal cues, has achieved state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets, indicating significant progress in video humor analysis 44. Furthermore, a study that utilized time-aligned user comments to generate unsupervised humor labels for videos achieved an F1-score of 0.73 in predicting humorous segments, demonstrating the effectiveness of leveraging user feedback 41.

The subjective nature of humor presents a fundamental hurdle for AI attempting to assess its presence in visual media 23. Humor is an intensely personal experience 23, and what elicits laughter in one person can be met with indifference or even offense by another 22. This variability is not only individual but also extends across different cultures and can even be influenced by transient factors like mood 22. Cultural context plays a pivotal role in shaping our understanding and appreciation of humor 1. AI, while trained on vast datasets of human-generated content, often lacks the real-world grounding and nuanced cultural sensitivity required to truly grasp the subtleties of humor that are specific to particular societies or communities 22. Furthermore, emotional intelligence, the capacity to understand and manage one's own emotions and to perceive the emotions of others, is crucial for both creating and appreciating humor 2. AI, in its current state, lacks genuine emotional experience, which limits its ability to understand the emotional underpinnings of humor and to judge whether something is funny in a way that aligns with human feelings 2. Humor often relies on shared human experiences, common knowledge, and an understanding of prevailing social norms, which can be difficult for AI to fully internalize 2. The effectiveness of humor is also heavily dependent on timing and delivery, aspects that are challenging for AI models to master, especially in dynamic mediums like video 2. The very essence of many jokes lies in their unexpectedness and incongruity – a clash between what is anticipated and what actually occurs – which can be difficult for AI, often designed to find patterns and logical connections, to predict and appreciate 1. Even defining a universal standard for what constitutes "funny" is a challenge that humans grapple with, further complicating the development of objective metrics for AI humor detection 9. Without a deep understanding of context and human sensibilities, AI-generated or AI-assessed humor can sometimes feel inappropriate or simply miss the mark 22. The process of training AI models using reinforcement learning from human feedback for tasks like humor detection is also complicated by the fact that human preferences for humor can vary so widely 23.

Looking towards the future, the potential for AI to understand and appreciate visual humor is significant, with ongoing advancements in AI models suggesting a promising trajectory 22. As Large Language Models continue to evolve and AI systems become more adept at parsing natural language and understanding context, their ability to discern humor is expected to improve 22. Some even believe that achieving human-level humor understanding could be a major milestone in making AI interactions feel truly human-like, perhaps even serving as the ultimate Turing Test 22. While AI may not entirely replace human comedians or humor critics, it has the potential to become a valuable tool in the creative process, acting as an "infinite idea generator" to assist human writers in brainstorming humorous concepts 6. Future research is likely to focus on incorporating a deeper understanding of incongruity, cultural contexts, and emotional nuances into AI models to enhance their humor detection capabilities 6. AI is already being used to generate jokes and other forms of humorous content with increasing sophistication, demonstrating a basic grasp of comedic structures 6. One exciting possibility is the personalization of comedy, where AI algorithms study an individual's reactions to different types of humor to tailor comedic content to their specific sensibilities 56. AI also has the potential to democratize comedy creation by providing intuitive tools that allow amateurs to produce polished humorous material without extensive resources 56. Future research may explore generating humor that goes beyond simple wordplay, delving into more complex forms of wit 38. Incorporating human-centric concepts like point of view, detailed observation, social understanding, and audience awareness will also be crucial for advancing AI's ability to generate and understand humor 38. The exploration of AI's capacity to understand humor in visual formats like memes is another active area of research 59. Furthermore, the use of AI for visual humor generation, creating absurd and delightful images, is also being investigated 56. Datasets like HumorDB are anticipated to play a vital role as benchmarks for developing more intelligent systems that can truly understand the nuances of visual humor 36. The role of advanced AI models like GPT-4 in analyzing and explaining visual humor in various forms, such as memes and cartoons, is also being explored, showcasing a growing capacity for AI to engage with visual wit on a deeper level 57. Future advancements in AI, potentially involving hybrid architectures that combine different AI approaches, personalized fine-tuning of models based on individual preferences, and the integration of multimodal learning that considers voice, video, and real-time feedback, hold the promise of significantly enhancing AI's understanding and appreciation of humor 23.

In conclusion, while artificial intelligence has made significant progress in analyzing images and videos, the ability to definitively determine if visual content is funny remains a complex challenge. Current AI models can perform many tasks related to visual understanding, and they are making strides in humor detection, particularly in multimodal contexts. However, the inherent subjectivity of humor, its deep roots in human culture and emotion, and the nuances of context and timing present significant limitations for AI's current capabilities. While AI may not yet possess a true "sense of humor" in the human sense, it is evolving into a powerful tool for analyzing and even generating humorous content. Ongoing research, the development of specialized datasets, and advancements in multimodal AI models suggest a future where AI will have a much more sophisticated understanding of visual wit, potentially serving as a valuable aid for content creators and enriching human-computer interactions.
